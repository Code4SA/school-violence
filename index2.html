  <p class="more">At the time the sunset fall, at least one child in the country will have decided to take his own life; another will have lost his due violence, five will have died on a accident and 12 will have passed because an illness afflicts them.<br>Overcoming mathematics, science and language is not the only challenge many children in South Africa has to overcome each day during their scholar years.<br>Death, even in those preventable cases, tears learners apart within the system, which has already collapsed and is full of challenges, which include overcrowded classrooms and a large amount of dropouts each year. These are the realities faced by the majority of South African learners.<br>City Press and <a href="http://academy.code4sa.org/" target="_blank">Code for South Africa</a> analysed data provided by the School National Survey to identify the causes of death of learners, recorded by several thousand schools.<br>This does not even count all the children under 18 years, but those who are reported by educational institutions.<br>The data is recorded by the <a href="http://www.education.gov.za/Portals/0/Documents/Publications/National%20Guidelines%20on%20SNAP%20Ordinary%202014.pdf?ver=2015-01- 29-160331- 687" target="_blank">Department of Basic Education</a> (DBE) at the beginning ofevery year and the sample only includes approximately 6, 000 schools across the country.<br>From 2012 to 2014, over the 20, 691 learner deaths recorded by schools, 1, 221 were indicated as being suicide (5,9%); 1, 219 were categorised as violence-homicide related (5,9%); 5, 533 due accidents (26,7%) and 12, 718 because by illness (61%).<br>According to the DBE, the data is “used to inform education policy makers and managers ... Provincial education departments also use the data for decision-making and planning purposes.”<br>They said it is “imperative” that every school throughout South Africa completed the survey and “submits accurate data in a timely manner.”<br>However, the very same Department refuses to explain in what policies the data has been used. In this analysis the Free State, for example, has been excluded from the breakdown analysis, because in 2014, it does not specify the various causes of death, and instead, merely reports the number of accidental deaths.<br>For 2013, the data shows a considerable increase in deaths in comparison to both 2012 and 2014. The DBE refused to comment on the accuracy of the data submitted and on what would motivate schools to reveal what could be damning information on their part.<br>What follows are a series of testimonies, interviews, and an attempt at understanding the reasons behind the numbers of deaths occurring at schools each year. It also looks at how preventable they are and the steps being taken by the government in the provinces most affected.<br>Only 532 860 learners wrote matric in 2014, of the 1 085 570 that started first grade twelve years ago, according with the Children’s Institute study.

  <h1 class="uppercase">Child crash victim</h1>
  <p class="byline">by LUBABALO NGCUKANA</p>

  <p>Bonke Ntulu, who was killed in a horrific crash on his way to school in 2013, wanted to be a doctor to help lift his family out of poverty.<br>But the grade 10 pupil died at the age of 19, and now his family has to pick up the pieces and face a bleak future.<br>Nolungisile  Ntulu, 59, said her heart still bleeds when she recalls the promises her son made to her before he died.<br>"He was such a good child. He wanted to study medicine in Cuba and come back to work in the country and build me a house, a proper house which I can be proud to live in," she said, fighting back tears.<br>Nolungisile lives in two dilapidated rondavels in Siqithini village in Libode, western Pondoland.<br>On March 6, 2013, the bakkie in which Bonke, his sister Buseka, and 10 other pupils from Mabalengwe Senior Secondary School were travelling in plunged down an embankment, killing six of its young passengers.<br>Bonke, who was in Grade 10 at the time, was in the front seat with another pupil and the driver. His sister, Buseka, now 23, was among the group of 10 pupils crammed in the back of the vehicle. She survived the crash but sustained severe head and neck injuries which have had far-reaching effects.</p>

  <p class="more">Nolungisile said the accident happened about 10 km away from their home, on the way to the school in the neighbouring village of Coza, about 40 km away.<br>"It was the most painful day of my life. I had lost my pillar. Bonke was very passionate about school even though he started schooling at an older age. He wanted to be better than most rural children. He wanted to achieve something meaningful in life. He had a purpose," she said.<br>Nolungisile still weeps today whenever she goes past the accident scene, or passes the wrecked Toyota bakkie which is still parked at the Libode Police Station.<br/>Her daughter dropped out of school last month. She believes the head injuries she sustained in the crash left her mentally impaired and affected her progress at school.<br>"She is very forgetful. Her concentration span is very short. She has changed completely since the accident, she seems confused all the time," Nolungisile said.<br>Buseka said she was no longer interested in school because despite her efforts to concentrate and study hard she has failed grade 12 three times since 2013. She has never failed any grade before.<br>"I wanted to be a social worker to help poor kids who have been abused. I am not sure how I am going to achieve my dream.  But for now I am taking a break from school maybe I will feel better one day and go back," she said.<br>Bonke was Nolungisile’s youngest out of her six children, four boys and two girls.<br>Her husband in 1998 and she has been trying to raise her children through money she is paid from odd jobs. She earns R640 a month through the Extended Public Works Programme in her village, where she is fixing potholes on the road where her son was killed.<br>The two rondavels she lives in, one used as a kitchen while another as bedroom, are collapsing. There are gaping holes in each of the grass-thatched roofs.  They use a fireplace on the floor to cook to save the little electricity money they have for lights only.<br>With no lawyer or assistance, Nolungisile and her daughter have travelled to East London and Mthatha to try and claim money for Buseka’s injuries.<br>"We went to the Road Accident Fund offices in East London two times and Mthatha also twice where Buseka has been examined by four different doctors. But nothing has happened. No money has been paid," she said.<br>The trip to East London from Libode costs her R580 for the two of them, while a trip to Mthatha costs R120.<br>She first went to the road accident fund in East London on May 19 2014 but there has been no news.<br>"All that I am praying for is that we can get money from RAF so that my daughter can get some medical assistance for the injuries she sustained to her head or get access to a special school. She wants to go back to school. That is the least thing I want because my son is gone forever," Nolungisile said.</p>
