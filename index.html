    <h1>Long commute to freedom</h1>

  <p class="para">Black people in particular bear the brunt of a decade-long focus on building houses instead of cities “at whatever cost”.</br>This according to a data-driven investigation by City Press and <a href="http://code4sa.org/" target="_blank">Code for South Africa</a>, which analysed the commuting time and access to public transport of commuters by race in the country’s largest cities.</br>The data, which was obtained from the most recent National Household Travel Survey, conducted in 2013 and released in 2014, shows that race remains a strong predictor of time spent travelling to and from work.</br>In addition to the effects of apartheid spatial planning, the country was slow out of the blocks after 1994 to counter this legacy.</br>Ndivhuwo Mabaya, the spokesperson for Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, says: “From 1994 to 2004, our focus was [on] eradicating the housing backlog, at whatever cost. Spatial planning was not taken into consideration. It is a challenge we identified when we did the 10-year review.”</br>Despite a change of strategy after 2004 – to one that prioritises proximity to work and economic opportunities – the pace of change is slow.</br>While Professor Karina Landman of the University of Pretoria acknowledges that spatial patterns “don’t change overnight”, Statistics SA boss Pali Lehohla points to data obtained from the 2001 and 2011 censuses, which reveal that population density in the major cities has remained the same.</br>“Look at Cosmo City [established in 2005], the north of Pretoria and the east of Pretoria: the cities are sprawling outwards. That is exactly what apartheid’s fathers did. What they are doing makes the cost of living and doing business ever more expensive,” Lehohla says.
  How expensive, exactly?</br>A nationwide analysis of the expenses of commuters shows that the 20% of the population with the lowest income spend on average R486 a month on public transport, while the 20% with the highest income report a cost of R585 a month – a much heavier burden for the poor considering the proportion the amount makes up of their household income.</br>Discussing Cape Town’s Transport Development Index, councillor Brett Herron, mayoral committee member for transport in the city, says: “We discovered that [within] our public transport system, 95% of the users are from the low- and low-to-middle income group, and perhaps what is most shocking is the cost of transport. In the low-income category of people, they are spending 45% of their household income on transport. In some parts of the city, like in Atlantis, it is almost 60%.”</br></p>

  <h2>Workers also sacrifice valuable time</h2>

  <p class="para">In the eight cities analysed for this investigation, including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, African and coloured people have the least access to public transport – measured by time spent walking to transport – and are forced to take longer journeys to work. For black residents of these cities, the average daily one-way commute lasts up to two and a half times that of white residents.</br>If you break down the data by household income, the difference remains. Among those who belong to a household earning less than R21 000 a month, black commuters spend on average 50 minutes travelling to and from work, while white people spend 36 minutes.In the eight cities analysed, black commuters in Pretoria are the worst off.</br>Makgorometje Makgata, the City of Tshwane’s strategic executive director for city planning and development, says in an effort to achieve spatial justice, a decision has been made that no major development will take place if it is more than 25km from the city. The city, he says, has approved two major high-density residential nodes towards Pretoria north and east.</br>“We are doing all this in an effort to bring people closer to the city.”</p>

  <p class="para">The National Household Travel Survey also measures how long it takes for commuters to reach the first available mode of transport, indicating how far they live from these services.
  In this instance, the worst city for black commuters is Cape Town, where black residents from households that earn less than R45 000 a month reported that it takes them 12 minutes to walk to their first available mode of transport, while for white residents, the average walking time is just three minutes. The same pattern can be observed in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Port Elizabeth.</br>Herron says the city has adopted a transit-oriented development strategy that is aimed at “ensuring that the development is aligned to our public transport network so we can start reducing travel time and cost. So [commuters] don’t use cars and can use public transport.”</br>However, the city’s plan to build new routes for its bus rapid transit (BRT) system is on a 20-year timeline.</br>“We have identified 10 new routes and we have planned BRT. In the public transport network plan, they want a new rail corridor that needs to be built. We are working with Prasa [the Passenger Rail Agency of SA], which already has a managing and planning team designing the route. We have 10 new BRT routes and one new rail route,” he said.</br>The National Household Travel Survey is conducted for the purposes of getting an “in-depth understanding of how and why people travel”</p>

    <h1>Getting to work ‘is a great risk’</h1>

  <p class="para">Pelican Park in Strandfontein, Cape Town, feels like a ghost town at 7am. Identical low-cost government houses sit alongside one another like matchboxes. The occasional dog barks in the distance. The quiet streets are badly lit and darkness hangs like a heavy cloak over them.</br>Yushra Adams (41), an activist involved in a handful of nongovernmental organisations, is dressed in a big leather coat with several layers underneath to ward off the winter cold. She has a hacking cough that breaks the silence every few minutes.</br>As she says goodbye, one of her five children locks up behind her. There is a small tuck shop, run by a family member who has already begun setting up for the day, next to  her home. It has a mesh window that shields the packets of chips and sweets that are on sale.</br>Adams rents out a room to earn extra money.</br>Heavy clouds gather. It is about to rain.</br>The area is “part of the territory controlled by a gang”, she says.</br>But Adams, who is outspoken against gender-based violence, says she will “never be attacked”.</br>“They’ve got great respect for me, actually.”</br>A field stretches out on either side of the road.</br>“Many women have been robbed here ... One morning, we picked up a body here,” she says, pointing and out of breath as she walks briskly to the safety of the busier road ahead.</br>“It’s a great risk for me, as a single woman and head of the house. I am providing for my family. Every day I work with that fear: will I [get there] safely?”</br>She climbs into a taxi as the rain begins to fall. The other passengers are quiet; a sleepy haze lingers.</br>After almost 40 minutes, covering a distance of only 10km, we arrive at the Wynberg train station.</br>Commuters’ feet crunch over piles of rubbish that have accumulated beneath a bridge near the station. After buying a ticket, Adams waits as a series of train-delay announcements blare over a speaker.</p>

  <p class="para">“There are times when the trains are late. You have to be up early to be here on time ... and then the train is late. It makes you late for your work,” she says.</br>“Sometimes you don’t have enough airtime to call your work. It jeopardises your work because sometimes the bosses don’t understand.”</br>When the train to the city centre finally arrives, the waiting throng pushes to get on board. Inside, people rush to find a seat or an open spot to stand. Small pools of rainwater have gathered on the train floor.</br>“I was lucky to find a seat today,” says Adams. “Usually, I have to stand. I think it is the weather.”</br>She speaks about the vulnerability of women on the train. “You get touched by people, pushed by people. I have been pickpocketed. I have seen people getting beaten up here by police. The train is not safe, especially for women.</br>After arriving at Cape Town station, Adams says this is the first time she has felt safe on the train, “because I had two journalists with me”.</br>Her commute, she says, is usually “painful”.</br>The 23km journey to the social development building (also known as the Standard Bank building) where Adams works part time as a data collector, took her an hour and 16 minutes by train and taxi.</br>Monthly travel costs for herself and her children are R1 860 – 53% of her monthly salary. She wishes she could travel some other way but, as the breadwinner for her five children, Adams has no other option.</p>

  <p class="para">Every weekday, Rebotile Busang (33), a registry clerk from Soshanguve, travels to work in Silverton, Pretoria, on a Putco bus.</br>Her workplace is 50km away, and she spends about 180 minutes daily on the bus.</br>Black residents of Pretoria spent the greatest amount of time in the country on public transport, a daily average of 80 minutes to work, a data analysis conducted by Code for South Africa and City Press found. And with 403 162 residents living to the north of Pretoria, in Soshanguve, that’s a lot of minutes every day.</br>It’s 4pm on a Friday afternoon and Busang knocks off work at the police logistics department in Silverton. Buses and taxis whizz past as we wait at the stop while the late-afternoon chill builds up.</br>City Press joins Busang for the R20 ride home. We take our seats in a fairly empty bus as she sits next to a friend. “Everyone is friendly on the bus. We are all from Soshanguve and we travel the same route every morning and evening to and from work,” she says.</br>“I buy a weekly bus ticket, which is R156. There is a monthly ticket, which can be bought, but I don’t trust the bus services because sometimes they don’t operate and then we are left stranded. It’s not as if we get that money back, so this is a safer way for me to plan my travel costs.”</br>Busang stays in Block F West, Soshanguve, with her daughter, Keloabetse; her grandmother, who receives a monthly state pension; her aunt, who sells shoes and clothing; and her cousin, who is a mechanic. Apart from the day-to-day running of the household, she also has to see to the transport costs of Keloabetse (7), as she travels to school with a lift club.</br>“For the two of us, I pay around R1 200 a month. That includes my bus tickets, and her transport to and from school,” she says. This equates to 10% of her monthly income.</p>

  <p class="caption">Rebotile Busang and her daughter, Keloabetse PHOTO: TEBOGO LETSIE</p>
  </div>

  <p class="para"></br>Aside from the cost, the travelling time eats away at Busang’s quality of life. “I am up every day at 3.30am because I have to make the lunches. My daughter wakes up at 4.30am. At first it was difficult for her to be up that early, but now she’s used to it.”</br>A woman walks down the aisle of the bus, selling chips and frozen yogurt.</br>“It’s going to be a long journey, my darling. You’ll get hungry and need to eat. These chips are only R1 a packet,” she says. Apart from her administration day job, she sells these snacks as a means to earn an extra income.</br>“Everyone on this bus is like family. In the morning, we even pray together,” she adds before leading them in a gospel song.</br>All around us, passengers begin to shut their eyes, succumbing to the weariness brought about by an early start.</br>At around 5.30pm, after battling through traffic, the bus finally arrives in Soshanguve.</br>Busang gets off at the third stop and walks the 10 minutes to her home.</br>It’s dark when she arrives and she is greeted by seven-year-old Keloabetse, who excitedly tells her about her day at school.</br>Busang says: “You know, if I don’t use the bus, I have to take two or three taxis to get to work, and it’s just too expensive and time consuming.</br>“I wish the government would do something about implementing reliable public transport for us, then life wouldn’t be so difficult. I still have to cook supper now and we are usually all in bed by 8pm. It’s a long day and we repeat the same routine weekly. But we’re used to it,” she says.</br>Keloabetse is eating a sandwich and drinking juice. “I don’t have any homework. I’m going to play with my cousin this weekend,” she says.</br>As her daughter eats, Busang busies herself with the evening tasks, seeing to her grandmother as she asks how her day was. She is about to cook supper for the family.</br>To get back to the bus stop in Silverton, City Press tries Uber. But there aren’t available cars in Soshanguve. By chance, an Uber driver from the township is on his way to a shift in Pretoria and picks us up, surprised to see our request on his phone. “If you logged the call five minutes later, I would have been gone and you would have to take taxis back to Silverton,” he says.</p>

  <p class="para">On a good day, it takes Edward Sadiki (43) just 15 minutes to drive from his house in Fleurhof in the west of Johannesburg to his workplace 12km away in Auckland Park.</br>Fleurhof is an integrated housing development, which is home to 9 600 fully subsidised RDP housing units.</br>Sadiki has called Fleurhof home for almost a year, after managing to secure a bond for his two-bedroom house on Minerva Road. “I am from Limpopo and moved to Soweto in 1996 for work. I stayed in Dobsonville.”</br>Sadiki moved to Fleurhof in search of better housing and a shorter commute. Because of the traffic coming out of Soweto, it used to take him an hour to get to work.</br>The bank administrator, who works for Absa, now saves up to 45 minutes per trip.</br>Even if there is traffic, he gets home early enough to spend time with his wife and four children, using the extra time for gardening “and odds and ends” around the house.</br>It’s Youth Day and City Press finds Sadiki painting his outside walls. “Before, I had to travel from Soweto to work and the travelling was horrible,” he says.</br>“We are happier now.”</p>
